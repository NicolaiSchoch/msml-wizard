====================================================
IDEAS for the Setup of an MSML Wizard/GUI
 - to lead through the MSML.XML-File writing process
====================================================

Notes:
======

- Facilitate automated filling of MSML.XML-Files
  (by the example of MSML-Input for HiFlow3-based Simulations on Liver/Heart/Aorta)
- Simulation-Scenarios-Management
  - Facilitate Variation of Parameters in specific ranges (related to UQ)
  - Facilitate Sets of Simulation Scenarios w.r.t. e.g. BCdata-Input sets.
    (e.g. w.r.t. Heart/MV-Surgery and different ring shapes (Nico),
          w.r.t. Radiotherapy scenarios and plan-of-the-day proposals (Markus),
          w.r.t. general UQ-methodology (Chen/Heuveline/H-its), ...)



Wizard Questions to lead through MSML.XML-File Filling/Creation Process:
========================================================================

Notation: <Question> <input type & option> <if/else-followUp>


- Which patient will you operate on?
  - textfeld: int number / name with reference to int number.

- Which organ will you operate on?
  - select: liver / heart / aorta

  - start Segmentation-process of <organ>
    -> output <segmented organ>

  - which accuracy [in mm] do you require the simulation to satisfy?
    - textfeld: int number
      (Question by Nico: can we include a checker, which tests the values on their reasonability?)

    -> start MeshGeneration-process of <segmented organ>
       -> output <meshed organ>

-> if liver:
    - Are the deformations caused by your surgical manipulation rather large?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if large:
              use corotated linear elasticity model
           elseif small:
              use linera elasticity model
    - The liver simulation will be set up using literature-based mean material properties of a liver. Are you fine with this?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              setup material parameters according to "lookup table"
              (can I give you a table where you access these values automatically?)
           elseif no:
              - Please give material properties of your choice!
                - Please give material parameter 'E-module'
                  textfeld: int number
                - Please give material parameter 'Poisson Ratio'
                  textfeld: int number
    - Do you want to consider uncertainties with maths-based methods of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              which parameters do you assume to be subject to uncertainties or prone to errors?
              - textfeld: blablubb
                -> ToDo Nico: Think about ways to act accordingly...
                For a first instance, we set up a set of simulation scenarios,
                varying the material parameters in the range [E+-\eps]
    - Will cutting processes be part of your liver operation?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              setup simulation using X-FEM ...

-> if heart:
    - Are the deformations caused by your surgical manipulation rather large?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if large:
              use corotated linear elasticity model
           elseif small:
              use linera elasticity model
    - The heart (mitral valve) simulation will be set up using literature-based mean material properties of
      a heart's valve leaflets. Are you fine with this?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              setup material parameters according to "lookup table"
              (can I give you a table where you access these values automatically?)
           elseif no:
              - Please give material properties of your choice!
                - Please give material parameter 'E-module'
                  textfeld: int number
                - Please give material parameter 'Poisson Ratio'
                  textfeld: int number
   - Which parameter do you want to set as the optimization goal? Size of Coaptation or Ring stress?
     -> if Size of Coaptation:
           do...
        elseif Ring stress:
           do...
    - Do you want to consider uncertainties with maths-based methods of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              which parameters do you assume to be subject to uncertainties or prone to errors?
              - textfeld: blablubb
                -> ToDo Nico: Think about ways to act accordingly...
                For a first instance, we set up a set of simulation scenarios,
                varying the material parameters in the range [E+-\eps]
    - Do you want to consider different MV-reconstruction scenarios
      (possibly building on maths-based methods of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ))?
      - select: yes / no
        -> if yes:
              You may vary the shape of the implanted AnnulusRing. Therefore, please choose a set of ring types.
              - textfeld: int number
                -> ToDo Nico: Think about ways to act accordingly...
                Set up a set of simulation scenarios, 
                varying the BCdata-input-file, w.r.t. Fixed/DisplacedDirichletBCs.
                @ Alexander: Can I use the template notation {{parameter}} for this, too?

-> if aorta:
    etc.

- What is the time frame of your operation and your operation steps?
  ...
  ToDo: maybe ask UniHD-RZ for availability of HPC-infrastructure apart from FZ-JÃ¼lich...?

- Do you need continuous visualization support or only visualization of step-by-step results?
  ...
